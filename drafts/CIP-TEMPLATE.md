_This is the suggested template for new CIPs._

## Abstract
_Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does._

## Motivation
_A motivation section should clearly explain why the existing protocol state is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves._

## Rationale

_The rationale describes what motivated the CIP and why particular design or process decisions were made. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It should include alternate designs/processes</span> that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature/process is implemented in other protocols. The rationale should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the CIP including technical and legal concerns._

## Expected Impact

_The CIP's expected impact should list measurable results for how Compound will be improved by its implementation. It might also take note of negative trade-offs mentioned in the Rationale section and demonstrate here that they are outweighed by the positive effects._

## Security Considerations _(optional)_
_While not always required for “Meta Process” or “Tooling & Support” CIPs, every “Protocol Enhancement” must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change._

## Additional Sections _(optional)_

_Additional sections or sub-sections may be added as needed._

## Copyright

_All CIPs must be in the public domain. The copyright waiver MUST link to the license file and use the following wording:_
